# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Objective

We were tasked to see if there were any advantages for SellBY to participate in the Vine program within Amazon. SellBY chrages a small fee and products are provided to Amazon Vine members to test and review products. We looked at videogames to determine if the Vine program would be advantageous for SellBy to particpate in. 

By pulling data from readily available datasourcse on the Vine program and breaking this down into paid and unpaid reviews we were able to generate the following results:

## Analysis Results

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  
  - Vine reviews totaled 94
    
  - Non-Vine totaled 40,471
    
- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  
  - 5-star Vine Reviews totaled 48
    
  - 5-star non-Vine reviews totatled 15,663
    
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
   
  - Percentage of 5-star Vine Reviews is 51.1%
    
  - Percentage of 5-star non-Vine reviews is 38.7%
    
## Summary

There are a small amount of 5-star paid reviews which is close to 12 points higher than the unpaid reviews. The amounts should be much closer which would lead us to believe that it might be possible that paid Vine members are apt to rate videogames better then the non-Vine members. 

We may also look at other data sets like office supplie or homegoods to determine if this is just a baised product.

We could also analyze the data sets for each individual star rating. If there is a bigger allotment of 4-star review, or what are the 1-star reviews saying. If there is a spread of reviews accross the star ratings it would possibly enlighten the SellBy management.
